						<h4> Computer Science Major vs Computer Scientist</h4>
						<p> <span style="padding: 0 40px"/> As of today, I am officially a declared Computer Science major at SMU, and apparently I'm supposed to be excited about that. Evidently, I've missed something culturally in the CS world because, to me at least, being a CS major is really not that exciting. </p> <p> <span style="padding: 0 40px"/>
	Now, that's not to say that I don't enjoy CS or don't think it's valuable. Quite the opposite, in fact. I think that computer science, despite being in what an observant economist might call something of a bubble, is becoming a trade as essential to modern life as any other that exists. That said, CS currently has a cultural 'sex appeal' which is unbefitting of the study, in my opinion. What with the enormity of buzzwords and misinformed but pervasive information about the computing world in popular culture (think "big data", cybersecurity, AI, etc.), the study of computer science has become as popular as business was in the baby boomer generation. The popularity of CS might not be inherently threatening at first glance, but I think it's important to recognize the disparity between what people think is going on in the tech world and what's <em>actually</em> going on. It's easy to look at the Silicon Valley tech giants and think that every computer science major ever is out there writing code for autonomous vehicles and robots, much in the same way it's easy to watch <em>The Wolf of Wall St.</em> and think that every accountant is playing golf and snorting cocaine. In reality, however, the majority of computer scientists are writing code that's been written a thousand times before for some company's website or database or mobile app, and most accountants (I would imagine) are reading Excel spreadsheets. Even at tech giants like Google, most employees are working on benign projects. I once spoke with a Google engineer in Boulder who told me she had spent two years working on a save button for Google Drive. Yes, she was probably making a large six-figure salary, but I would argue that she is, in fact, a computer science major, not a computer scientist.
	</p>
	<p> <span style="padding: 0 40px"/> The essential problem with the current CS world is that the majority of people working CS-related jobs are basically no different than accountants -- they write code that any other programmer could write and get paid to do it. Now, I have nothing wrong with accountants, but accounting doesn't have the 'sex appeal' of computer science (I use the phrase 'sex appeal' to refer to the popular interest in CS, because my observation has to this point concluded that the CS world objectively does not conform to the literal meaning of 'sexy'). The problem therein is that this popular culture rage about CS is leading a remarkable amount of young people into the CS world who haven't the slightest idea what they're getting into. They're looking at six figure salaries and pool tables at Silicon Valley HQs and are ignoring the fact that they're turning themselves into a commodity whose supply is going to more than double in the next few years. I'm no economist, but that must mean that the demand, and therefore the pay, for "coders" is going to fall dramatically. I call these people "CS majors," because their interest in computer science, in college at least, is limited to the fact that it is their major. They go to class, do their lab assignments, and after four years graduate and expect to be working with the next big thing in Silicon Valley tech, but quickly degenerate into 9-to-5 employees who, while admittedly making six-figure salaries, are doing objectively uninteresting things. A computer scientist, on the other hand, is someone who actively pursues CS as not just a major, but a way of life, almost. A computer scientist is someone whose thought is actively motivated by computing. These are the people who, despite often not actually majoring in CS, find ways to use programming and computing to solve little problems and do fun things in their lives. These are the people who end up building self-driving cars and weird social networks. There are precious few of these people, and, while they're doing very cool things, I think it would benefit my generation to realize that these people are few and far between, and that being a computer science major is, at it's core, no different than being a business major. Yes, it's probably much more difficult and interesting, but it's not going to make you the next Steve Jobs; it's more likely going to make you the next John Doe writing code from 9-to-5.
