						<h4> Day 0 (Saturday, May 21)</h4>
						<p> Today we arrived in Weimar, Germany after a trip from Denver through DFW and Frankfurt. I flew from Dallas with Jacob, Ben, and Fontenot and we took the train from Frankfurt to Weimar. When we arrived, we were greeted by Christina, one of our 'tutors' (paid friends) here in Weimar. We had to walk from the train station to our apartments, since there was a Nazi demonstration happening in the town center, so taxis couldn't get by. It seemed reasonably tame, but there were lots of heavily armed police around. After we unpacked and settled in to our small, but reasonably nice apartment, we went to the grocery store and we stocked our fridge with lots of food (lots of bratwurst and various beers). We have a nice little kitchenette with some pots and pans so we can make some food while we're here. We then went out for dinner at a very delicious restaurant about 100 feet from our apartment called "Doner Kebab". We all had these massive and delicious Doner Kebabs (which are basically like overfilled meaty tacos) for 4 euros each. Afterward, we walked around town a little and then watched the second half of the Manchester United game before going to sleep.</p>

						<h4> Day 1 (Sunday, May 22)</h4>
						<p> After a solid 13 hours of sleep, Ben and I woke up and decided to go on a run today at the park. The park is absolutely amazing. It's around 6 square kilometers by my best approximation, and it's just full of pretty spots. There's a big river that runs through it, and a realy pretty flower garden. We even found an abandoned building that was built into the side of a big hill, which was super cool. The run ended up being pretty short -- lots of pollen and such, so we decided to walk around and see the park that way. Afterward, we went to the Sunday market and ate some bratwurst from a stand; they were so delicious. There are some photos of all of these things on <a href="https://www.icloud.com/sharedalbum/#B02G4TcsmGTZpEC">our iCloud photo stream</a>. After lunch we came back and worked in the apartment for a bit before going out to a Biergarten with the whole group, along with the tudors. I'm starting to get pretty comfortable with the lay of the land here, since we spent so much of the day today exploring. Later today Ben and I are going to grab dinner at whatever local pub we can find with Kevin and Lee. We've decided to try to not go to the same restaurant twice for the first week so that we can try lots of different places!</p>
