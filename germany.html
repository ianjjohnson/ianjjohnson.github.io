						<h4>Day 9 (Monday, May 30)</h4>
						<p>
						Back to school today. Had a nice long sleep last night, and woke up with a bowl of cinnamon toast crunch -- riveting stuff. We discussed <em> The Sorrows of Young Werther </em> in German culture class, and then C++ went short because we had yet another walking tour today. Went on a 2-hour tour of Weimar, all around places where I've walked around numerous times now. Wasn't the most exciting thing ever. Apparently we have two more walking tours tomorrow. Ben and I are starting to think that this is more like walking tours abroad than study abroad. Anyhow, afterward I went to the ATM and we went to the store and stocked up on some food. I did a load of laundry and wrote the paper we got assigned today for the German culture class, and then Ben and I made dinner for ourselves. We pan-seared two butterflied bratwurst and then put them on baguettes with Sambal Oelek cheese and sauteed onions. We even browned the bread a little in the bratwurst fat, which gave it a nice brown and crunch. I put some pictures on the photo stream. They were delicious, but could have used a little mustard, and the sambal cheese wasn't very spicy, which was somewhat disappointing. Afterward, we went to the park to play frisbee, but some SMU people stole my frisbee so we used this crappy one from the grocery store, which got old fast so we went and sat on a bench and pontificated for some time about lots of things. Our childhoods, dogs, the crazy idea that there are 7 billion people on Earth and each has his own life and experience, various possible superpowers (if you were telepathic, would you rather have read or write access to other people's brains??), and so many other things. We think it'd be a lot of fun to find internships in the same place next summer so we can get an apartment together and cook a ton. We've really enjoyed cooking here so far. We're also thinking about trying to only speak Spanish together, which could be super cool. It'd help us get a lot better at it. Turned into another late night here, so we're gonna go to sleep now in a bit. Tomorrow more class, and more walking tours (ugh).

						<h4>Day 8 (Sunday, May 29)</h4>
						<p> We're back in Weimar! We woke up early this morning, packed, ate breakfast, and walked to the train station to head back to Weimar! After two train rides, we made it back to Weimar and walked straight back to the apartment where we dropped off our stuff, started a load of wash, and wasted no time in going to get some Doner Kebabs with Kevin and Lee. The four of us then went to get some gelato, which was outstanding -- so delicious! Afterwards, Ben and I hung up our laundry to dry and then went to the park where I finished my reading for class, and he caught some (somewhat cloud inhibited) rays. We then came back and I finished grading the first set of C++ labs and got caught up on emails. Then I made bratwurst for everyone for dinner, with some help from Kevin, while Ben and Fontenot went to an organ concert. It was quite a cooking adventure, with around a dozen people in a kitchen of around than 50 square feet. I played a little catch with a frisbee while a few others cleaned the kitchen, and now I'm showered and in bed, ready for a long night of sleep before the first full week of class!</p>

						<h4>Day 7 (Saturday, May 28)</h4>
						<p> It's the end of day three in Berlin and we're exhausted. This morning we got up and ate breakfast and went straight to the train to Potsdam, where we went on a walking tour of the Brandenburg parliament area. After the tour we went to the Dutch quarters, where there was this adorable street of all Dutch stores. We went to a little restaurant called Poffertjes and Pannekoeken which was wonderful. Not super authentic but they had Grand Mariner and chocolate ice cream poffertjes which were amazing. Afterward we visited the big famous park in Potsdam, the name of which is escaping me. It was quite pretty, and we visited a palace there, but my feet were in an unbelievable amount of pain because I spent the whole day in dress shoes. After that we went back to the hotel, grabbed a quick dinner, and then got on the train for the opera. We just finished the first half, and now it's intermission. I recognized one of the songs from Hopscotch, which was super fun (the show is "The Marriage of Figaro"). Everyone is struggling to stay awake.  Lots of people have fallen asleep during the show. I'm very eager to get back to the hotel, back to Weimar, and to Holland. Ben and I are becoming very fed up with the other people here. Anyhow, tomorrow morning we return to Weimar by train, and not a moment too soon. 
						<br />
						Update: currently waiting for the bus back to our hotel. The opera ended up being three and a half hours long, so we're pretty tired!</p>

						<h4>Day 6 (Friday, May 27)</h4>
						<p> Early morning this morning after the sun came in around 5:30. I hadn't realized that we had a second curtain we could close. Ben woke up after an hour or so and we hung out for a bit before deciding to go have breakfast. I was so sketched out by the showers that I decided to use a washcloth and body wash to 'shower' with the sink in our room. We then went downstairs where we had breakfast with Fontenot and hung out for a bit before embarking out for the Jewish museum. The museum was beautiful, but our tour guide wasn't great and many other members of the SMU group were very loud and disrespectful and greatly worsened the experience there. After the museum, we went back to the hotel where we picked up Cooper who had come from the Berlin airport. She was tired but we took her out to breakfast at this awesome Mexican place (what a first meal in Germany...) and then we went and hung out in a little park before going to the KaDeWe, the Berlin equivalent of Harrod's. It was amazing. The food courts, as expected, were the highlight! After that we went to the famous Tiergarten of Berlin, where we sat in the grass and walked around for a while. The garden was so gorgeous and vast, we had a wonderful time. At the end of the garden walk, we started to walk toward the German parliament building where we had a night tour. Lots of roads were closed due to the Berlin marathon, or some such event, which is currently going on here. Since roads were closed we got to walk down the middle of the big street which leads up to the Brandenburg gate. It was wonderful. The tour of the parliament building was wonderful and afterward we went up in the big glass dome on top. We're now on a subway on the way back to our apartment, after we just stopped at McDonalds for a near-midnight snack because a McFlurry sounded just right after a long day without eating or drinking anything even moderately cold. Another wonderful day full of fun adventures. Tomorrow to Potsdam and the opera!</p>

						<h4>Day 5 (Thursday, May 26)</h4>
						<p> This morning Ben and I got up and walked to the train station to head to Berlin! After a beautiful two hour train ride, we arrived in Berlin at the downtown train station. There was a big fun advertisement for Ritter Sport chocolate! We took another train to our hotel where we settled in before walking around to find lunch. We went to lunch with Kevin, Lee, and Tristan at this adorable little market which is a few blocks from our hotel, wrapped around a park. The lunch was fantastic, and we even had some berry smoothie with it. Afterward we stocked up on a few things from the grocery store (including Ritter Sport marzipan chocolate for only 1.09 Euro!!). Then we went on a four (yes, four) hour walking tour of historic Berlin which was wonderful. So many beautiful sights. The city is generally cleaner and prettier than I had expected. After the tour, we had some pizza with Prof Fontenot and then some gelato. I spoke a bunch of Spanish with the gelato store clerk which was super fun. We then took a train back to the hotel where we're going to sleep soon. The hotel is a little bit of a dive. One bathroom shared by 7 rooms, and we leave our keys at the check-in whenever we leave, plus we half to climb 6 flights of stairs to get to our room, but it's all good! We're enjoying an authentic and exciting Berlin experience! It's probably even going to make us excited to be back in our tiny little bedroom in Weimar. That's all for tonight. Tomorrow we have a tour of the Jewish Museum and the German parliament, and then to Potsdam on Saturday, which I'm very excited for! </p>

						<h4>Day 4 (Wednesday, May 25)</h4>
						<p> Second day of class! It was another good day -- started with some scrambled sausage and eggs, then another information-dense two hours in my culture class. I've decided to sit in on all of the C++ lectures to work on my own stuff and help out if needed. Afterward Ben and I chatted with Fontenot for a bit -- sounds like Ben is going to do the Data Structures labs for C++ class to keep himself a little bit more entertained. After that, we went to the park for a very long time. We placed some soccer, threw a frisbee, and just hung out for a while. It was lots of fun. Afterward, we came back and I went to get pizza with Fontenot. The pizza, like every meal I've had here so far, was delicious. After that, I came back and showered and I'm now going to bed somewhat early so that I can get up and pack my bag for Berlin in the morning. I won't be bringing my computer to Berlin, but I'm going to write down my journal entries on paper so that I can type them up once I get back. Until then, I'll hopefully have WiFi on my phone so we can all keep in touch!</p>

						<h4> Day 3 (Tuesday, May 24)</h4>
						<p> Last night we had a wonderful dinner at a local restaurant, and then Ben and I went straight to sleep with headphones in to ameliorate the sound of riotous SMU students. This morning we made omelettes and then went to our first day of class! I was pretty overwhelmed by my first class, but I think it should be alright (hopefully). Between classes we got Brats from the stand on the corner near our apartment -- they were delicious! In C++ (the class I'm TAing), the first assignment was given out and so after class I spent at least 2, maybe 3 hours helping people with that, but Ben and I also went for a nice long walk in the park and got some delicious dinner (we may have violated the no-repeat rule). So far, Ben and my discussions have been quite nerdy and interesting. At dinner the first night we contemplated whether the Joule was defined as a function of the Kelvin, or vise-versa. We guessed that the Kelvin was defined based on the Joule, since Joules equal KgM/s^2, which was possible to measure far before temperature was. Today we contemplated a possible joint research project idea, and also discussed various algorithms to predict whether or not someone would think that a new person they meet is an asshole, based off of a number of different factors, including what other people think the new person is an asshole. We considered a few algorithms based on directed graphs, and some based on discrete classification, such as the CBA algorithm I've been working on. So far I think the best solution is just to judge for one's self. Turned into a late night tonight because of the amount of TA work I had to do, but Ben and I rigged up some towels in our windows behind our blinds to keep the morning light out, so hopefully we'll sleep better!</p>

						<h4> Day 2 (Monday, May 23)</h4>
						<p> After a nice pizza dinner last night, Ben and I went to sleep at around 10, only to be awoken at midnight when some other SMU people came back to the apartments. Neither of us were able to fall back asleep at all, so at 05:00, after 2 total hours of sleep, we got up and made some scrambled eggs with pepper, onions, and spicy chorizo. They were delicious! We had everything cleaned up and all the dishes washed before 06:00, so it was an early morning! We spent a few hours reading and working and then the tutors came to bring us to orientation. We went to the University, where we were greeted in a classroom with coffee, pastries, and sandwiches, in true SMU / PS fashion! We met our professors, talked about the upcoming week, and then headed back to the apartments. The tutors showed us how to use the German laundry machines (spoiler: they're just like American ones) and then we all walked around Weimar for the early afternoon to see other spots the tutors wanted to point out (the university dining hall, some other places to eat). Then we got back to the apartment where I managed to sneak in 90 minutes of shuteye while Ben worked on some data structures assignments. Now I'm going to grab coffee with Fontenot to discuss my independent study, and then the whole program is going out to dinner. Afterward, I'm going to go directly to sleep to try to catch up on sleep before class starts tomorrow! The adventure continues!</p>

						<h4> Day 1 (Sunday, May 22)</h4>
						<p> After a solid 13 hours of sleep, Ben and I woke up and decided to go on a run today at the park. The park is absolutely amazing. It's around 6 square kilometers by my best approximation, and it's just full of pretty spots. There's a big river that runs through it, and a realy pretty flower garden. We even found an abandoned building that was built into the side of a big hill, which was super cool. The run ended up being pretty short -- lots of pollen and such, so we decided to walk around and see the park that way. Afterward, we went to the Sunday market and ate some bratwurst from a stand; they were so delicious. There are some photos of all of these things on our iCloud photo stream. After lunch we came back and worked in the apartment for a bit before going out to a Biergarten with the whole group, along with the tudors. I'm starting to get pretty comfortable with the lay of the land here, since we spent so much of the day today exploring. Later today Ben and I are going to grab dinner at whatever local pub we can find with Kevin and Lee. We've decided to try to not go to the same restaurant twice for the first week so that we can try lots of different places!</p>

						<h4> Day 0 (Saturday, May 21)</h4>
						<p> Today we arrived in Weimar, Germany after a trip from Denver through DFW and Frankfurt. I flew from Dallas with Jacob, Ben, and Fontenot and we took the train from Frankfurt to Weimar. When we arrived, we were greeted by Christina, one of our 'tutors' (paid friends) here in Weimar. We had to walk from the train station to our apartments, since there was a Nazi demonstration happening in the town center, so taxis couldn't get by. It seemed reasonably tame, but there were lots of heavily armed police around. After we unpacked and settled in to our small, but reasonably nice apartment, we went to the grocery store and we stocked our fridge with lots of food (lots of bratwurst and various beers). We have a nice little kitchenette with some pots and pans so we can make some food while we're here. We then went out for dinner at a very delicious restaurant about 100 feet from our apartment called "Doner Kebab". We all had these massive and delicious Doner Kebabs (which are basically like overfilled meaty tacos) for 4 euros each. Afterward, we walked around town a little and then watched the second half of the Manchester United game before going to sleep.</p>
