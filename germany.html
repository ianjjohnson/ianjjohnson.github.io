						<h4>Day 18 (Wednesday, June 8)</h4>
						<p>
						Over halfway done with our adventure -- that seems so crazy to me! I slept in this morning until around 10, when I ate a banana for breakfast and went straight to class to start getting some work done. I worked on my second paper for history/culture class for a while, and then went to class. In C++ we had a test, so that was nice and laid back for me today -- got some good work done on the R project I've been working on for my independent study. After class, I grabbed a brat and we went to the train station to go to Erfurt for the afternoon. When we got to Erfurt, we met our tour guide who took us on a tour of the city, which was pretty cool actually. We visited a couple of beautiful cathedrals with big organs which were quite amazing. At the end of the tour, we went to a little German restaurant for dinner, where I had a worst and some apple tart (yum! was the first time I've had it since we got here). After that, we walked straight back to the train station and returned to Weimar. Back in Weimar, most of the group got ready to head out to some Turkish bar, and I got packed up for Holland! Afterward, I went upstairs to check on Kevin and help out him and Lee with their C++ labs. Now I'm getting my last packing items done, reviewing my plan for tomorrow, and soon I'll shower and get in bed. Sorry for a short entry today. Wasn't a terribly exciting day, and I'm in a hurry to get ready and get to bed.

						<h4>Day 17 (Tuesday, June 7)</h4>
						<p>
						Woke up this morning and made some breakfast for Ben, Lee, and our injured Kevin. I just made scrambled eggs with peppers, onions, and cheese. Nothing too exciting. Afterward, I spent some time with Kevin and Lee just messing around and chatting before we then went to class. Kevin couldn't go to class today due to his back pain, so things are not well on that front, but they seem to be improving with the new meds he got from the doctor yesterday. In culture, we got our papers back, and we all did pretty well so I'm happy about that. Lee and I grabbed brats before C++, and then during class we discussed dynamic memory allocation and I worked a lot on my research project. I've reached a point with the project that I'm done with all the actual programming and code optimization, so now I'm dealing with all of these annoying formatting protocols, etc. which is starting to get pretty frustrating. My goal is to have the R package completed before I head to Holland for the weekend, but who knows. Anyhow, after class we all went on a tour of the Anna Amalia Library here in Weimar, which was actually pretty cool, even though the whole walking tour thing is really pretty overdone. They had lots of cool old books, and the building was gorgeous. They also had an incredible bust of Dante which I found to be quite impressive. After the tour, Dr. Gaettens and Prof. Fontenot gave us all a talking to about being more respectful about quiet hours in the apartments, and about keeping the apartments clean. People didn't seem to take it super seriously, but I was really glad that they addressed the issue in some fashion, because it's really becoming an issue. Our apartment is just so dirty all the time. People leave the bathroom and kitchen dirty all the time, which bothers me. It's not a germaphobe issue so much as a general mental outlook issue -- it's just not very gezellig to live in a dirty space. Anyhow, after that I went back to the apartment and got my culture book and a towel and came back to the park to read and sunbathe. Ben and I lay out in the evening sun for 90 minutes or so, until the sun went down behind the trees. It was wonderful. Afterward, I came back to the apartment (got some ice cream on the way!) and got some work done for a while, before going to meet Fontenot to talk about the independent study. We met at the ice cream place (again...) and he got this tiramisu which was just outstanding (yeah, I tried some). Then Ben, Lee, and I went out to an Italian place for dinner, and then headed back to the apartments. Right when we got back we ran into a group headed to the park to play frisbee. I joined along with them and threw the frisbee around for an hour or so before stopping early because I skidded barefoot and bare-legged across a gravel path, which was a tremendously painful experience which cost me as much skin and blood as it did dignity. Anyhow, I came back, showered, and went to check on Kevin for a while. He seems to be in better spirits, which is nice. Now I'm headed to sleep. Less than 48 hours from some good old family time with amazing food on the Dwarsweg -- can't wait!

						<h4>Day 16 (Monday, June 6)</h4>
						<p>
						Today was the German history and culture midtermm. Woke up extra early after a great night's sleep and make scrambled eggs with Kevin, Lee, and Ben. Afterward, Kevin, Lee, and I studied for a few hours before the exam, and then we went and took it. Kevin's back was really killing him so we loaded him up with Advil and got him through the exam. It wasn't terribly hard, but I think I may have really goofed up the last essay. Anyhow, what's done is done. After the exam, I went to C++ and did some grading and then worked on my project for a while. Afterward, I grabbed a brat and then came back to check on Kevin. He was in lots of pain, so we called the SMU-Abroad health emergency people, who set up an appointment for him at an urgent care facility nearby. Lee took him. While he was there, Ben and I went to the park and I read while he studied for his German exam tomorrow. Once again, it was a beautiful and sunny day, so it was really nice to go to the park. Then I went to the store and bought stuff to make various forms of grilled cheese, since Kevin had requested it for dinner. After I got all the stuff, I came back and worked on my project for a while longer before starting to cook dinner! I made lots of grilled cheese for various people, with various types of cheeses. They were all quite good I'm told, but I ddin't have one because I had eaten two slices of pizza out of the fridge already. Anyhow, afterward I spent a few hours just relaxing and chatting with Kevin and Lee, which was really nice. Tomorrow we're planning on having an early breakfast again. Sorry this entry was a little short again -- it's about midnight and I'm exhausted. Also, once again no contacts in so I apologize for typos. Three days from now I'll be on the Dwarsweg, and I can't imagine a happier fate.

						<h4>Day 15 (Sunday, June 5)</h4>
						<p>
						We're back! After going to sleep at around 2:30 this morning, I woke up at around 7 to get ready to head to Fontenot's to make Sunday brunch for the whole gang! Kevin, Lee, and I went to Fontenot's at 8 and immediately started cooking. We made lots of great stuff. We had croissants, bacon, and brats, as well as scrambled eggs with some accoutrements. The highlight though, was this adventurous thing I made, inspired by what Lori Cohen made for bcunch at Margot's graduation. I got a baguette, hollowed it out, filled it with eggs (mixed with some milk and cream), peppers, and proscuitto, and then glazed it in butter and cooked it in the oven. When it was almost done, I covered it in cheese and put it on broil to give the cheese a nice crunch. The whole thing was off-the-charts awesome and delicious, and it was pretty quickly devoured by the 15-or-so people that came. Afterward, I stuck around for a while and finished all the dishes, and then went back to our apartments. Ben and I went to the park where we sunbathed (yay, sun!!) for a while and did our homework, before then going on a little walk and discussing plans for the President's Scholars talent show on the retreat in Taos (we're MC'ing it this year). We got a lot of sun. I think Ben got burned a little, and I may have too. After we came back, I spent a few hours grading for C++, eating brats with ben, and then studied a bit for culture with Kevin and Lee before the three of us then went out for dinner and ice cream. After I came back, I showered, discovered I had a tick bite (ugh) and then got ready for bed. Overall, a wonderful and relaxing day. We're supposed to get more sun this week, which I'm excited for, and then I go to Holland on Thursday -- so excited! That's all for today. I apologize for any typos, etc. as I'm writing without contacts or glasses so I can't really see the keyboard, or what I'm writing. Hopefully it's okay! Photos, as usual, in the stream. Mostly of food, again. What can I say, I'm so domestic.

						<h4>Day 14 (Saturday, June 4)</h4>
						<p>
						Today was the big hiking day! We got up at 6 in Weimar, finished our packing, made some scrambled eggs, and went straight to the train station! Our first train was a regional one from Weimar to Leipzig. That ride was pretty uneventful -- mostly passing through the typical farmland and rolling hills. Then we had a second train from Leipzig to Dresden, on which we had assigned seats. At Dresden Haupbahnhauf (main train station), we walked around a bit and Ben got a cheese croissant before we got on the third leg of the train ride. The third train ride was beautiful -- we went through a lot of national park land along the Elbe river. When we got off the train, it was like we stepped straight into wonderland. Stadt Wehlen is absolutely beautiful. We took a ferry across the stunning Elbe, and immediately started our walk. The signage was quite bad for the hike, so we ended up wandering around some random trails for about a half hour before actually starting in the right spot. Once we started, we were cruising. We hiked at a pretty solid pace for the first hour and a half, before we decided to check out a little viewpoint and have lunch. At the viewpoint we realized we had gone astray from the Malerweg, so we backtracked for a while to get back on track. After backtracking, we came to an area called Bastei, where there's a beautiful old bridge. We took lots of photos and walked across the bridge and through the gorgeous rock formations and continued along the path. For a while, we were on a pretty standard mountain hiking trail, until suddenly out of nowhere we stumbled across this adorable little restaurant wedged between two large rock faces and hanging above a stream running between them. We took some photos there, and then kept walking. We found a spot where you could canoe through the river in this beautiful little valley, but we were a little worried about time so we decided to keep walking. After quite a bit more mountain trail hiking, we got to a flatter area where the trail suddenly opened up into a beautiful scene of rolling hills, wheat fields, and a few little towns. We walked off the trail for a while in this area along a road because it was so pretty and we wanted a better view. After we got back on the trail, we came across a little town that was a poorly labeled fork in the path. We ended up backtracking a few times, but we eventually found the path, which took us to another wonderful little town, where we wandered around for a while before heading to Stadt Hohnstien, the end of the path. The final path to Stadt Hohnstien was once again in a densely wooded area with lots of incline -- it was wonderful. We ended up getting to Stadt Hohnstien about 2 hours before our bus was going to leave there, so we scoped out the bus stop, and then went and found a little park where we ate our remaining food, which did little to sate our appetites. But we did make friends with two little red bugs whom we named Larry and Stephanie! We went back to the bus stop, and 1 minute before the bus was supposed to arrive, it just drove straight by us. We ran up the street and waved it down, only to discover that it was actually a different bus with the same route number. We walked back to the bus stop where we then got on the right train. I showed our Deutsch Bahn ticket to the driver, and she was very upset with me. I'm pretty sure that the busses are free so she was upset that I was wasting her time. Anyhow, we drove the bus through these windy, hill-dense roads as if we stole the thing until we eventually got to Bad Schandau, where our train was set to depart an hour later. We were both ravenous, and the restaurant there was closed. Luckily, we spotted a Lidl across the river. We very briskly watched to the nearest bridge, and went over to the Lidl, which, much to our delight, was still open! We bought a baguette, extra old Gouda cheese, lots of cherries, some water, some Ritter Sport, a huge bag of Haribo bears, and, last but most certainly not least: stroopwafels! We made it back to the train station with 15 minutes to spare, ate our dinner, and then went to the platform to get on the train. We managed to get on the train and into our seats, and then we had some dessert! There are some girls sitting by us who are speaking Dutch -- they're headed to Amsterdam! That's a very long trip, as we were on the very eastern side of Germany. Anyhow, we're going to try to sleep for a while. We have about 5 hours on this train before a 1:30AM arrival in Weimar! According to my phone, we had 37,000 steps, 20 miles travelled, and 179 'flights climbed.' What a day, and the weather was great, too! We had mostly overcast skies with about 75 degrees and high humidity, but no rain. I'll post photos as soon as possible! I'm honestly pretty surprised and happy that we managed to make it all work so far. Lots of train changes, navigation, time management, etc. and we managed to make it this far! We've been rewarding ourselves with gummy bears for the first 90 minutes of the train ride. They're very sweet. Update: we made it back to Weimar. The train stopped in Leipzig for 90 minutes which had me worried, but it was all okay. We met a few guys from Georgia Tech on the train who were mechanical engineering students here learning German. After we got back, we went for a midnight Doner run! It was delicious, and also not technically midnight but in reality 2AM. We're now back, showered, and finally going to sleep!

						<h4>Day 13 (Friday, June 3)</h4>
						<p>
						At some point it will become redundant to point out that it rained again today, but, nonetheless: it rained a lot today. We woke up at 7:30 and made omelettes before Ben had to go to class. Today they were ham and gouda. I think the gouda was a great addition, but the ham wasn't as good as the proscuitto. Nonetheless, they were quite good again. We decided today on a menu for the Sunday Fontenot Brunch (Kevin and I are going to cook). He's going to make French toast and biscuits, and I'm going to make some sort of egg dish (maybe omelettes, maybe something more exciting). We're excited for that -- it should be a lot of fun. More history in class today, and then in C++ we announced the second homework and the third programming project. That whole TA-ing thing has really turned out to be a lot of extra work. At first, I had thought that this would be a breeze because I'm only in one class (since the independent study doesn't meet for 2 hours a day), but in reality I think I'm working a whole lot more than everyone else, since the independent study has been a ton of work, and I'm doing at least 2 hours of TA work a day on top of sitting in on the C++ class. Anyhow, after class I went with Kevin, Lee, and Fontenot to get Doner. I had a Doner burrito/wrap today, which was absolutely amazing. We hung out and talked for a while about all the possible career opportunities for CS people, and what we're all going to do with our lives. It was nice. Afterward, we went for ice cream, which was absolutely incredible, and then I came back to the apartment and worked for a while. Ben finished the second data structures assignment, and then we got our stuff ready for the hike tomorrow and then we went to the park and threw a frisbee for a while before then going out for a big dinner with the whole group (not quite the whole group, but about 14 of us, I think), which was lots of fun. We just got back to the apartment, and we're hoping to make it an early night. Tomorrow, we'll get up around 6:30, have a big breakfast, and head out for our hike! We're all prepared (we think...) and super excited! We won't get back until after 1AM on Sunday morning, so I won't be posting any pictures or an update until around noon Weimar time on Sunday, when I'll also have to study like mad for the culture exam. Update: went on a late-night run with Tristan through the park, which was beautiful, spooky, and maybe a bad idea the night before the early morning and the big hike!

						<h4>Day 12 (Thursday, June 2)</h4>
						<p>
						More rain today. I woke up early and made breakfast again. ('Early' is a stretch -- I got up at like 9). I made omelettes for Kevin, Lee, Clay, and myself. They were even better than yesterday (same stuff -- proscuitto, pepper, onion, cheese). Afterward, we all went to class. In German Culture class, we discussed this very odd play called Woyzeck, and then we got our study guide for the exam. I think the exam shouldn't be too bad. After class, I decided not to go to C++ (I'm allowed to do that, I promise), and I went on a run instead. It was threatening rain but the forecast said light rain, if any, so I didn't think much of it. I got out to the park, ran about 4 miles or so, and it just started absolutely pouring rain. We're talking Noah's ark type water here; this was no little sprinkling. I immediately turned around and started running (at a pace I haven't hit in quite a while, I'd add) back to the apartment. I got back absolutely drenched in water, but luckily I was able to make it back before the rain fried my phone (that's the reason I had to hurry back). I came inside and took a nice hot shower and by the time I got out it was sunny outside. I guess Denver isn't the only place with bipolar weather. Anyhow, after that I worked for a few hours on my research project and studying for my culture midterm (plus a little FaceTime with the Holland crew), and then Ben and I went for a little walk at the park and threw the frisbee a little bit. We had Doner kebabs (see pics in the photo stream!) on the way back, which were delicious, as always, and after we got back we got to FaceTime with Grace for a bit, which was awesome! Then Ben FaceTimed with his mom for a while (today was the day of FaceTime), and now we've been working for a few hours. He's working on the data structures assignments while I study and work on my research. Tomorrow we have to prepare for the big day Saturday! We're very excited. Hoping to make it an earlier night tonight, but who knows! I'm going to go on a little evening/night walk around town for a bit to decompress from all the homework-doing.

						<h4>Day 11 (Wednesday, June 1)</h4>
						<p>
						Rainy day today in Weimar. Got up early and made prosciutto, pepper, onion, and cheese omelettes with Kevin (they were amazing - photos on the stream!). Then I got some C++ grading done before class. Class was pretty uneventful. We found out we're going to get our study guide for the first German culture midterm tomorrow, so that should be interesting. Today was only the second full day of C++, due to all the walking tours we've had. To make up for lost time we had a few hours of "lab" where we all went to Fontenot's apartment for pizza, C++, and a fun little social gathering. It was really great. Before that, and after class, since it was rainy Ben and I stayed in and finalized our weekend plans. On Saturday we're going to go on a day hike and then on Sunday we'll have a picnic in the park! All exciting things. Lots of work today, and lots more to do still this week, but we're really excited for Saturday -- it should be lots of fun! Tomorrow will be more class, rain, and work, but hopefully we'll get enough sun to go to the park a bit! Update: Ben, Clay, and I went to the park to unwind for a bit and threw a frisbee for over an hour. Since it was rainy today there was an unbelievable mist over the whole park as the sun went down; it was stunning.

						<h4>Day 10 (Tuesday, May 31)</h4>
						<p>
						Another day of class this morning, and another day cut short for more walking tours. Started the day with some "Frosties" (Frosted Flakes) and a Banana, and then went to class. I've become accustomed to having a bratwurst from the bratwurst stand by our apartment after class every day, because I can get one for 2.50 euro, and they're super delicious. After class, and C++, which was cut short, we went on a tour of Goethe's house and garden, and then of an exhibition of his life and works. It was reasonably cool, but, as you're likely aware at this point, I'm really sick of walking tours. We went with Fontenot and Jacob and got Doner Kebabs for dinner and then we had ice cream at this really great little dessert place in the town square. We had two dishes, one was Tiramisu and one was strawberry and vanilla ice cream with a plethora of fruits on top. They were outstanding. There should be some pics of them on the photo stream soon. After that, Ben and I got some work done for a while and tried to pick somewhere to go for our day trip this weekend. We're thinking we'll do a day hike somewhere pretty. To end the day, we went to the park and threw a frisbee for a bit, which was lots of fun, and then we came back. The WiFi is having continued issues; it's basically impossible to get on the internet in our apartment. Hopefully it'll be resolved soon, if not I'll have to exclusivelly connect to the internet from at the university. Anyhow, it's another late night as people are up and making noise while they work on their C++ homework, which is due in 20 minutes. Tomorrow, our first uninterrupted day of class. That should be nice. Tomorrow night we're having dinner and a coding session for C++ at Fontenot's apartment, and I think I'm in charge of making dessert!

						<h4>Day 9 (Monday, May 30)</h4>
						<p>
						Back to school today. Had a nice long sleep last night, and woke up with a bowl of cinnamon toast crunch -- riveting stuff. We discussed <em> The Sorrows of Young Werther </em> in German culture class, and then C++ went short because we had yet another walking tour today. Went on a 2-hour tour of Weimar, all around places where I've walked around numerous times now. Wasn't the most exciting thing ever. Apparently we have two more walking tours tomorrow. Ben and I are starting to think that this is more like walking tours abroad than study abroad. Anyhow, afterward I went to the ATM and we went to the store and stocked up on some food. I did a load of laundry and wrote the paper we got assigned today for the German culture class, and then Ben and I made dinner for ourselves. We pan-seared two butterflied bratwurst and then put them on baguettes with Sambal Oelek cheese and sauteed onions. We even browned the bread a little in the bratwurst fat, which gave it a nice brown and crunch. I put some pictures on the photo stream. They were delicious, but could have used a little mustard, and the sambal cheese wasn't very spicy, which was somewhat disappointing. Afterward, we went to the park to play frisbee, but some SMU people stole my frisbee so we used this crappy one from the grocery store, which got old fast so we went and sat on a bench and pontificated for some time about lots of things. Our childhoods, dogs, the crazy idea that there are 7 billion people on Earth and each has his own life and experience, various possible superpowers (if you were telepathic, would you rather have read or write access to other people's brains??), and so many other things. We think it'd be a lot of fun to find internships in the same place next summer so we can get an apartment together and cook a ton. We've really enjoyed cooking here so far. We're also thinking about trying to only speak Spanish together, which could be super cool. It'd help us get a lot better at it. Turned into another late night here, so we're gonna go to sleep now in a bit. Tomorrow more class, and more walking tours (ugh).

						<h4>Day 8 (Sunday, May 29)</h4>
						<p> We're back in Weimar! We woke up early this morning, packed, ate breakfast, and walked to the train station to head back to Weimar! After two train rides, we made it back to Weimar and walked straight back to the apartment where we dropped off our stuff, started a load of wash, and wasted no time in going to get some Doner Kebabs with Kevin and Lee. The four of us then went to get some gelato, which was outstanding -- so delicious! Afterwards, Ben and I hung up our laundry to dry and then went to the park where I finished my reading for class, and he caught some (somewhat cloud inhibited) rays. We then came back and I finished grading the first set of C++ labs and got caught up on emails. Then I made bratwurst for everyone for dinner, with some help from Kevin, while Ben and Fontenot went to an organ concert. It was quite a cooking adventure, with around a dozen people in a kitchen of around than 50 square feet. I played a little catch with a frisbee while a few others cleaned the kitchen, and now I'm showered and in bed, ready for a long night of sleep before the first full week of class!</p>

						<h4>Day 7 (Saturday, May 28)</h4>
						<p> It's the end of day three in Berlin and we're exhausted. This morning we got up and ate breakfast and went straight to the train to Potsdam, where we went on a walking tour of the Brandenburg parliament area. After the tour we went to the Dutch quarters, where there was this adorable street of all Dutch stores. We went to a little restaurant called Poffertjes and Pannekoeken which was wonderful. Not super authentic but they had Grand Mariner and chocolate ice cream poffertjes which were amazing. Afterward we visited the big famous park in Potsdam, the name of which is escaping me. It was quite pretty, and we visited a palace there, but my feet were in an unbelievable amount of pain because I spent the whole day in dress shoes. After that we went back to the hotel, grabbed a quick dinner, and then got on the train for the opera. We just finished the first half, and now it's intermission. I recognized one of the songs from Hopscotch, which was super fun (the show is "The Marriage of Figaro"). Everyone is struggling to stay awake.  Lots of people have fallen asleep during the show. I'm very eager to get back to the hotel, back to Weimar, and to Holland. Ben and I are becoming very fed up with the other people here. Anyhow, tomorrow morning we return to Weimar by train, and not a moment too soon. 
						<br />
						Update: currently waiting for the bus back to our hotel. The opera ended up being three and a half hours long, so we're pretty tired!</p>

						<h4>Day 6 (Friday, May 27)</h4>
						<p> Early morning this morning after the sun came in around 5:30. I hadn't realized that we had a second curtain we could close. Ben woke up after an hour or so and we hung out for a bit before deciding to go have breakfast. I was so sketched out by the showers that I decided to use a washcloth and body wash to 'shower' with the sink in our room. We then went downstairs where we had breakfast with Fontenot and hung out for a bit before embarking out for the Jewish museum. The museum was beautiful, but our tour guide wasn't great and many other members of the SMU group were very loud and disrespectful and greatly worsened the experience there. After the museum, we went back to the hotel where we picked up Cooper who had come from the Berlin airport. She was tired but we took her out to breakfast at this awesome Mexican place (what a first meal in Germany...) and then we went and hung out in a little park before going to the KaDeWe, the Berlin equivalent of Harrod's. It was amazing. The food courts, as expected, were the highlight! After that we went to the famous Tiergarten of Berlin, where we sat in the grass and walked around for a while. The garden was so gorgeous and vast, we had a wonderful time. At the end of the garden walk, we started to walk toward the German parliament building where we had a night tour. Lots of roads were closed due to the Berlin marathon, or some such event, which is currently going on here. Since roads were closed we got to walk down the middle of the big street which leads up to the Brandenburg gate. It was wonderful. The tour of the parliament building was wonderful and afterward we went up in the big glass dome on top. We're now on a subway on the way back to our apartment, after we just stopped at McDonalds for a near-midnight snack because a McFlurry sounded just right after a long day without eating or drinking anything even moderately cold. Another wonderful day full of fun adventures. Tomorrow to Potsdam and the opera!</p>

						<h4>Day 5 (Thursday, May 26)</h4>
						<p> This morning Ben and I got up and walked to the train station to head to Berlin! After a beautiful two hour train ride, we arrived in Berlin at the downtown train station. There was a big fun advertisement for Ritter Sport chocolate! We took another train to our hotel where we settled in before walking around to find lunch. We went to lunch with Kevin, Lee, and Tristan at this adorable little market which is a few blocks from our hotel, wrapped around a park. The lunch was fantastic, and we even had some berry smoothie with it. Afterward we stocked up on a few things from the grocery store (including Ritter Sport marzipan chocolate for only 1.09 Euro!!). Then we went on a four (yes, four) hour walking tour of historic Berlin which was wonderful. So many beautiful sights. The city is generally cleaner and prettier than I had expected. After the tour, we had some pizza with Prof Fontenot and then some gelato. I spoke a bunch of Spanish with the gelato store clerk which was super fun. We then took a train back to the hotel where we're going to sleep soon. The hotel is a little bit of a dive. One bathroom shared by 7 rooms, and we leave our keys at the check-in whenever we leave, plus we half to climb 6 flights of stairs to get to our room, but it's all good! We're enjoying an authentic and exciting Berlin experience! It's probably even going to make us excited to be back in our tiny little bedroom in Weimar. That's all for tonight. Tomorrow we have a tour of the Jewish Museum and the German parliament, and then to Potsdam on Saturday, which I'm very excited for! </p>

						<h4>Day 4 (Wednesday, May 25)</h4>
						<p> Second day of class! It was another good day -- started with some scrambled sausage and eggs, then another information-dense two hours in my culture class. I've decided to sit in on all of the C++ lectures to work on my own stuff and help out if needed. Afterward Ben and I chatted with Fontenot for a bit -- sounds like Ben is going to do the Data Structures labs for C++ class to keep himself a little bit more entertained. After that, we went to the park for a very long time. We placed some soccer, threw a frisbee, and just hung out for a while. It was lots of fun. Afterward, we came back and I went to get pizza with Fontenot. The pizza, like every meal I've had here so far, was delicious. After that, I came back and showered and I'm now going to bed somewhat early so that I can get up and pack my bag for Berlin in the morning. I won't be bringing my computer to Berlin, but I'm going to write down my journal entries on paper so that I can type them up once I get back. Until then, I'll hopefully have WiFi on my phone so we can all keep in touch!</p>

						<h4> Day 3 (Tuesday, May 24)</h4>
						<p> Last night we had a wonderful dinner at a local restaurant, and then Ben and I went straight to sleep with headphones in to ameliorate the sound of riotous SMU students. This morning we made omelettes and then went to our first day of class! I was pretty overwhelmed by my first class, but I think it should be alright (hopefully). Between classes we got Brats from the stand on the corner near our apartment -- they were delicious! In C++ (the class I'm TAing), the first assignment was given out and so after class I spent at least 2, maybe 3 hours helping people with that, but Ben and I also went for a nice long walk in the park and got some delicious dinner (we may have violated the no-repeat rule). So far, Ben and my discussions have been quite nerdy and interesting. At dinner the first night we contemplated whether the Joule was defined as a function of the Kelvin, or vise-versa. We guessed that the Kelvin was defined based on the Joule, since Joules equal KgM/s^2, which was possible to measure far before temperature was. Today we contemplated a possible joint research project idea, and also discussed various algorithms to predict whether or not someone would think that a new person they meet is an asshole, based off of a number of different factors, including what other people think the new person is an asshole. We considered a few algorithms based on directed graphs, and some based on discrete classification, such as the CBA algorithm I've been working on. So far I think the best solution is just to judge for one's self. Turned into a late night tonight because of the amount of TA work I had to do, but Ben and I rigged up some towels in our windows behind our blinds to keep the morning light out, so hopefully we'll sleep better!</p>

						<h4> Day 2 (Monday, May 23)</h4>
						<p> After a nice pizza dinner last night, Ben and I went to sleep at around 10, only to be awoken at midnight when some other SMU people came back to the apartments. Neither of us were able to fall back asleep at all, so at 05:00, after 2 total hours of sleep, we got up and made some scrambled eggs with pepper, onions, and spicy chorizo. They were delicious! We had everything cleaned up and all the dishes washed before 06:00, so it was an early morning! We spent a few hours reading and working and then the tutors came to bring us to orientation. We went to the University, where we were greeted in a classroom with coffee, pastries, and sandwiches, in true SMU / PS fashion! We met our professors, talked about the upcoming week, and then headed back to the apartments. The tutors showed us how to use the German laundry machines (spoiler: they're just like American ones) and then we all walked around Weimar for the early afternoon to see other spots the tutors wanted to point out (the university dining hall, some other places to eat). Then we got back to the apartment where I managed to sneak in 90 minutes of shuteye while Ben worked on some data structures assignments. Now I'm going to grab coffee with Fontenot to discuss my independent study, and then the whole program is going out to dinner. Afterward, I'm going to go directly to sleep to try to catch up on sleep before class starts tomorrow! The adventure continues!</p>

						<h4> Day 1 (Sunday, May 22)</h4>
						<p> After a solid 13 hours of sleep, Ben and I woke up and decided to go on a run today at the park. The park is absolutely amazing. It's around 6 square kilometers by my best approximation, and it's just full of pretty spots. There's a big river that runs through it, and a realy pretty flower garden. We even found an abandoned building that was built into the side of a big hill, which was super cool. The run ended up being pretty short -- lots of pollen and such, so we decided to walk around and see the park that way. Afterward, we went to the Sunday market and ate some bratwurst from a stand; they were so delicious. There are some photos of all of these things on our iCloud photo stream. After lunch we came back and worked in the apartment for a bit before going out to a Biergarten with the whole group, along with the tudors. I'm starting to get pretty comfortable with the lay of the land here, since we spent so much of the day today exploring. Later today Ben and I are going to grab dinner at whatever local pub we can find with Kevin and Lee. We've decided to try to not go to the same restaurant twice for the first week so that we can try lots of different places!</p>

						<h4> Day 0 (Saturday, May 21)</h4>
						<p> Today we arrived in Weimar, Germany after a trip from Denver through DFW and Frankfurt. I flew from Dallas with Jacob, Ben, and Fontenot and we took the train from Frankfurt to Weimar. When we arrived, we were greeted by Christina, one of our 'tutors' (paid friends) here in Weimar. We had to walk from the train station to our apartments, since there was a Nazi demonstration happening in the town center, so taxis couldn't get by. It seemed reasonably tame, but there were lots of heavily armed police around. After we unpacked and settled in to our small, but reasonably nice apartment, we went to the grocery store and we stocked our fridge with lots of food (lots of bratwurst and various beers). We have a nice little kitchenette with some pots and pans so we can make some food while we're here. We then went out for dinner at a very delicious restaurant about 100 feet from our apartment called "Doner Kebab". We all had these massive and delicious Doner Kebabs (which are basically like overfilled meaty tacos) for 4 euros each. Afterward, we walked around town a little and then watched the second half of the Manchester United game before going to sleep.</p>
